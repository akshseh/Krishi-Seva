# Krishi-Seva (Farmer's friend)

Issues like the lack of smart farming knowledge, involvement of middlemen between farmers and the government, and lack of awareness w.r.t various beneficiary schemes existing for farmers, have been addressed through the proposed solution or our product.

It's a smart web-app for farmers which recommends crops according to the data collected by ICAR, the climatic conditions and the water availability in that area. 
You can also buy/sell your crops using that app.

_Theme_:  *Governance & Digital Inclusion*
